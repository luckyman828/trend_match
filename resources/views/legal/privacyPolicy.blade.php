    <p>We at Trendmatch ApS. ("Kollekt," "we," "us," or "our") have created this privacy policy (this "Privacy Policy") because we want you to know how information you provide to us is used and shared. This Privacy Policy relates to the information collection and use practices of Trendmatch-Kollekt (Kollekt) in connection with our Service which is made available to you through our Website (including mobile web) located at&nbsp; <a href="{{URL::to('/')}}">{{URL::to('/')}}</a>, our App and our Platform (which may be accessed via the Website or App).</p>
    <p>By visiting our Website or using our Platform, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying&nbsp;Terms of Service.</p>
    <p>Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in our Terms of Service.</p>
    <p>See our Terms of Service here: <a href="{{URL::to('/')}}/terms-of-service">{{URL::to('/')}}/terms-of-service</a></p>
    <p><strong>Scope of this policy</strong></p>
    <p>The Website and the Platform are operated by Trendmatch in Denmark and complies with Danish and European law. If you are located outside of the EU, please be aware that any information you provide to us may be transferred to, processed, maintained, and used on computers, servers, and systems located outside of the EU, where the data protection laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>In an attempt to make everyone&rsquo;s lives easier we treat everyone towards the standards of the GDPR (General Data protection rules). Read more about that here: <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">https://gdpr-info.eu/</a></p>
    <p>In short there are 3 important points.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>As a company we are obligated to tell you what personal data we collect, why we collect it and how we use it, and who else has access to it</li>
    <li>As an individual you may at any time request to know what data we have on you, and request that it is deleted. Do this by sending an email to <a href="mailto:Simon@trendmatch.dk">Simon@trendmatch.dk</a></li>
    <li>As a company we are obliged to have a plan in place in case of a data leak, and to notify the involved parties as soon as we realize the leak.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Information We Collect and How We Use It</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Your email
    <ul>
    <li>We need this in order to let you login to the services, and send you information about system status and updates, such as scheduled downtime.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Your country
    <ul>
    <li>We need this information so other people in your organization can identify which region you represent</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Aggregate Data</strong></p>
    <p>In an ongoing effort to better understand our users and the Website, we might analyze your information in aggregate form to operate, maintain, manage, and improve the Website. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents, and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our products and services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>
    <p><strong>Business Transfers</strong></p>
    <p>In the event of a merger, dissolution or similar corporate event, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, we expect that the information that we have collected, including personal information, would be transferred to the surviving entity in a merger or the acquiring entity. All such transfers shall be subject to our commitments with respect to the privacy and confidentiality of such personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p><strong>Disclosure to Public Authorities</strong></p>
    <p>We are required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including for the purpose of meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose personal information to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities or required by law or regulation including, but not limited to, in response to court orders and subpoenas.</p>
    <p><strong>Retention of personal information</strong></p>
    <p>We will retain your personal information in a form that identifies you only for as long as it serves the purpose(s) for which it was initially collected as stated in this Privacy Policy, subsequently authorized, or as allowed under applicable law.</p>
    <p><strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong></p>
    <p>We take very seriously the security and privacy of the personal information that it collects pursuant to this Privacy Policy. Accordingly, we will implement reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in processing and the nature of such data, and comply with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
    <p><strong>In case of a data breach</strong></p>
    <p>Should we, despite our efforts to secure your data, be the victims of a data breach the following will happen.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>When we notice the breach, the clock starts and our CTO is notified. We now have 24 hours to identify what data has been compromised.</li>
    <li>After 24 hours an email will be sent out. As a user you will receive one of 3 emails
    <ul>
    <li>If your data has not been compromised, we will let you know that there has been a data breach, but your data has not been compromised</li>
    <li>If we are unsure, we will let you know we have had a data breach, that your data may be compromised</li>
    <li>If we know your data has been compromised, we will let you know which data has been compromised and which data may be compromised.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In parallel with this an investigation is launched into the breach, how to contain it and how to secure against it in the future.</li>
    </ul>
